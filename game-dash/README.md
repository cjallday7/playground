This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Steam API Configuration
STEAM_API_KEY=your_steam_api_key_here
STEAM_ID=your_steam_id_here

# OpenXBL API Configuration  
OPENXBL_API_KEY=your_openxbl_api_key_here
```

### Getting API Keys:
1. **Steam API Key**: Get from [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
2. **Steam ID**: Find yours at [Steam ID Finder](https://steamidfinder.com/)
3. **OpenXBL API Key**: Get from [OpenXBL](https://xbl.io/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
